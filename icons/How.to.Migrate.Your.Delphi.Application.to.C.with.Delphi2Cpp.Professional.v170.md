# How to Migrate Your Delphi Application to C++ with Delphi2Cpp Professional v1.7.0
 
If you are a Delphi developer who wants to port your application to C++, you might be wondering how to do it without spending too much time and effort. You might also want to keep developing your application with Delphi and translate the code periodically, or switch to C++Builder or another tool for further development. In any case, you need a reliable and efficient tool that can convert your Delphi code to C++ code automatically and accurately.

That's where Delphi2Cpp Professional v1.7.0 comes in handy. Delphi2Cpp Professional is a powerful and easy-to-use program that can translate your Delphi source files to C++ code in minutes. It supports Delphi 7 and all the features of the VCL and other included units. It can produce code for any C++ compiler, but it is especially compatible with C++Builder, which has similar language extensions as Delphi. It can also generate code for other compilers like Visual C++ or gcc without Delphi properties.
 
Delphi2Cpp Professional is based on a complete parser for Delphi 7 and uses the type information of the VCL and other units to achieve optimal translation results. You don't have to prepare your source code in any way. You can set the definitions for conditional compilation in the options of Delphi2Cpp and the code will be pre-processed during the translation. You can also customize the output format, indentation, comments, and other aspects of the generated C++ code.
 
Delphi2Cpp Professional has a user-friendly interface that allows you to select the source files or folders you want to convert, choose the target compiler and output folder, and start the conversion with a single click. You can also use the command-line version of Delphi2Cpp for batch processing or integration with other tools. Delphi2Cpp Professional will show you the progress and status of the conversion, as well as any errors or warnings that might occur.
 
Delphi2Cpp Professional is not only a tool for one-time conversion, but also a tool for continuous development. You can use it to keep your Delphi and C++ code synchronized, or to migrate your application gradually from Delphi to C++. You can also use it to learn C++ by comparing the original Delphi code and the translated C++ code.
 
Delphi2Cpp Professional is a must-have tool for any Delphi developer who wants to migrate their application to C++ or use both languages simultaneously. It can save you a lot of time and effort, as well as ensure the quality and compatibility of your C++ code. You can download a free trial version of Delphi2Cpp Professional from [developer.team](https://developer.team/delphi/27218-delphi2cpp-professional-v170.html) [^1^] or buy a full version with lifetime updates and support for only $199.
